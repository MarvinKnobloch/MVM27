# Crawler
The crawler crawls along the ground, at any angle or slope;
from its start position to its waypoint.

## Patrol
- Upon start, it will determine the direction the waypoint is from 

## Combat
- Collision with the player will cause damage to the player
- A configurable timer will start to decide when damage can be done again

## Visuals
- Note: The transition from ground to wall and vice versa will not look fantastic.
